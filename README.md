### Hi there, I'm Isaí 👋

My work operates at the boundary between **hardware and intelligence**. I don't just use tools; I deconstruct them to understand their mechanics. My engineering philosophy is built on the belief that robust systems come from a deep understanding of the fundamentals—from the logic gate to the learning algorithm.

### 🔭 My Core Focus

I operate in three main domains. They are not separate interests; they are layers of the same mission.

*   🧠 **AI & Scientific Computing:**
    My curiosity drives me to look under the hood. I learn by building. This has led me to implement algorithms from scratch and replicate research papers (e.g., Transfer Learning, GWO) to truly grasp the internal logic behind the libraries. Currently focused on **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** and their implementation on hardware.

*   ⚙️ **C++ & Systems Programming:**
    This is my foundation. Whether building a CPU emulator (like the Intel 8080) or optimizing code for resource-constrained environments, I prioritize memory efficiency and architectural clarity. I write code designed to be close to the metal.

*   ⚡ **Hardware & FPGAs:**
    Bridging the gap between software and silicon. I explore Digital Design (VHDL) and Edge AI, implementing logic on platforms like the **Basys 3 (Artix-7)** to bring algorithms into the physical world.
