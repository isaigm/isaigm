# Isa√≠ Garc√≠a

My work is centered on a single principle: building robust, efficient systems at the intersection of hardware and software. I don't just use tools; I deconstruct them to understand their core. My approach is forged from a belief that true innovation comes from mastering the fundamentals‚Äîfrom the logic gate to the learning algorithm.

This isn't just about writing code. It's about creating order and resilience in a world that tends toward chaos.

### My Core Focus

I operate in three main domains. They are not separate interests; they are layers of the same mission.

*   üß† **AI & Scientific Computing:** My curiosity doesn't stop at the surface. When a technology interests me, I need to see how it works from the inside. This has led me to implement algorithms and replicate papers (e.g., Transfer Learning with PyTorch, GWO). I learn by building and deconstructing, not just by using.

*   ‚öôÔ∏è **C++ & Systems Programming:** This is my foundation. I build from the ground up, whether it's a CPU emulator (Intel 8080) or performance-critical applications. I write code intended for environments where efficiency and reliability are non-negotiable.

*   ‚ö° **FPGAs & VHDL:** This is the bridge between the two worlds above, and my current area of intense focus. My prior experience with hardware in the Navy sparked an interest that's now becoming a central part of my mission: bridging intelligent computation directly to the silicon. This is the future I am building towards.

### Current Status

I am currently preparing for a Master's degree, with a deep dive into VHDL and FPGA architecture. My objective is to contribute to the fields of Edge AI and Neuromorphic Computing.

I am always open to connecting with engineers, researchers, and thinkers who are working on hard problems. If you are building something that matters, something that is resilient by design, let's talk.
